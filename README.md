## Project Ideas

### 1. Image Classification Web Application
Build an application that can classify images into various categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Users can upload images, and the application will predict the image category based on the trained machine learning model.

### 2. Chatbot Development
Create a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to engage with users and answer their queries. Implement a user-friendly interface and integrate machine learning algorithms to enhance the chatbot's responses over time.

### 3. Fitness Tracker App
Design a full stack fitness tracker application that monitors users' physical activities, diet, and health data. Leverage machine learning algorithms to provide personalized fitness recommendations based on the user's preferences and goals.

### 4. Stock Price Prediction System
Develop a system that uses historical stock data and machine learning models to predict future stock prices. Implement a user interface to visualize stock price trends and provide insights for investors.

### 5. Malware Detection System
Build a system capable of identifying and classifying malware using machine learning techniques. Develop a user-friendly interface for users to scan and detect potential threats in their systems.
